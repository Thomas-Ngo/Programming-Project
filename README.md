Food Safety Game Development V30.08.2025

## Hi guys, please read this to help out on consistent development in Unity!

GitHub Practises:
When pushing new items into main please edit the version title to the date of your push eg Date is the 30th of August 2025, so label the version number as V30.08.2025. VXX.XX.XXXX

Relevant Console Commands for commits and push, and to fix GitHub for healthy practises:
- git checkout <branch-name> (used to keep changes in the current branch you're working on when you transition between branches)
- git checkout -b <branch-name> (to create a new branch with items based on the branch you are currently in)
- git pull <branch-name> (to pull from the specific branch)

If there ever is a time where main branch is not updating based on other branches anymore let the team know so that we'll find a way to fix it.

Trello Practises:
When working on a specific function, make sure that you are adding the work onto Trello too to keep the Sprint Tasks updated. Once you are ready to show it to the team drag the work to "Ready to Present" and let us know of it. Once the team has approved of it, and is also approved by our client, move the item to its relevant sprint collumn.

- Android and iOS support (File > Build Settings > Android and/or iOS downloaded)
