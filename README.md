Hi guys, please read this to help out on consistent development in Unity

How to Set Up Unity:
1. Download Unity and launch Unity Hub
2. Open GitHub and find the repository. Clone the repo in VSCode by copying the HTTPS link given. (If need help ask me :D) If done properly the folder should be in your User folder under your name, please check there.
3. At the top right labelled "Add" select "Add project from disk". Select your saved repository and launch.
4. When the environment eventually loads it is to be expected that the environment should come out as empty or should not see anything yet. Please don't panic! Just go to the "Assets" folder and click on "SampleScene" (by default) and click on that to load up the scene in Unity
5. What you should be seeing is a plane and a bean as of right now. We will work on one scene at a time and rename when we can :D


WHEN YOU DO EVENTUALLY COMMIT SOMETHING MAKE SURE THAT YOUR UNITY IS CLOSED SO THAT ALL SAVED CHANGES ARE READY TO BE COMMITED AND PUSHED :D
BEFORE YOU DO PUSH AS WELL MAKE SURE TO PULL ALL RELEVANT FILES AND LUNCH IN LOCAL UNITY ENVIRONMENT, THEN COMMUNICATE WITH THE TEAM THAT YOUR WORK IS READY TO BE COMMITED SO TAHT NO CONFLICTS ARE TO HAPPEN
